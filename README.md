# Multi-Layered Architecture Application

This project is a working prototype designed to demonstrate a Multi-Layered Architecture using SQL Server, ADO.Net, Microsoft Visual Studio, and Text File Handling. Built with a clear separation of concerns, it includes a Presentation Layer for the user interface, a Business Logic Layer for core processing and validation, a Data Access Layer for database interactions, and a Data Layer that directly connects to SQL Server. The prototype also uses text file handling for supplementary data management, such as logging. This structure ensures modularity, scalability, and maintainability, aligning with best practices for enterprise-grade application development.
